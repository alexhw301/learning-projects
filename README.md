A compilation of small programs that are/were difficult to me and that make me feel smarter than I was before.  

### blurb.cpp
A program that accepts user input, and ends if the input correctly matches the way the alien language works for one word.  
The language is composed of Blurbs; a Blurb is a word.  
A Blurb is a Whoozit, followed by zero or more Whatzits.  
A Whoozit is an x, followed by one or more y's.  
A Whatzit is a q, followed by either a d or a z, and then followed by a Whoozit.  
Program continues to ask user for a correct input until they type a working Blurb, then ends.  
Examples of Blurbs include: "xyqd", "xyyyyyyyqz", "xyqdxy", "xyyqzxyyyyyyyqzxyqdxyyyyy".
