# learning-projects
A compilation of small programs that are/were difficult to me and that make me feel smarter than I was before.  

### blurb.cpp
*takes user input, and ends if the input is a proper word in the alien language*

The language is composed of Blurbs; a Blurb is a word. A Blurb is a Whoozit, followed by zero or more Whatzits. A Whoozit is an x, followed by one or more y's. A Whatzit is a q, followed by either a d or a z, and then followed by a Whoozit.  

Examples of Blurbs include: 
- xyqd
- xyyyyyyyqz
- xyqdxy
- xyyqzxyyyyyyyqzxyqdxyyyyy

Personal reflection: I definitely abused if-statements to get it working, which could make it hard for me to change the program in the future if I ever wanted to. Not sure what else could make this more efficient / better to read though, especially since it's a simple program. Maybe I'll learn something relevant in my upcoming data structures class :)
